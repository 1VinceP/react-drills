# React Drills
## Set 1

1. Create a basic react app where you type in a text box and it shows up as text somewhere else on the screen.

2. Create an app where there is an array of data (in the component's state) that is shown on the screen as a list

3. Create an app where there is a list of data on the screen (from component's state) where you can type to filter what's shown in the list.

4. Create an app hitting an api (swapi.co, birdapi.com, pokeapi, smurfs, marvel api, etc).

5. Make a larger app if you have time.

## Set 2

6. Create a "login" element component that includes two text inputs, "username" and "password", and a button ("login"). When the login button is clicked, show an alert.

7. Create a component that is passed an image string via props and renders the image via an `<img />` tag.

8. Create an app that displays your to-do list. You will need two components, your App component and a Todo component. Pass individual to-do items as props to the Todo component.
    - To-do list on App component state.
    - Todo component renders 1 to-do item.



## Set 3 (Routing)

9. Create an app that has three routes (using `react-router-dom`):
   * home `'/'`
   * sign up `'/signup'`
   * details `'/details'`

- Create a simple menu for each view that allows you to navigate between all three routes.

- Use any of the APIs listed in app #4 above and display the data in the details route.

10. Create an app that has two routes (using `react-router-dom`):
      * products `'/'`
      * details `'/details/:id'`
  - Hitting an api, show all products/info/people (depends on the api you hit) on the `products` route.
  - When you click on a specific product, show the details in the `details` route.
